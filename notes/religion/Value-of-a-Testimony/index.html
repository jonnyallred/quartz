<h1 id=context>(Context)</h1>
<p>This was a talk I gave in Stake Priesthood meeting in the summer of 2016. I&rsquo;m certain I was given the assignment because I decided to be very frank with my <a href=/quartz/glossary/stake rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/glossary/stake>Stake</a> Counselor about my lack of certainty. He assigned me to give a talk on the value of a testimony shortly afterward. I think he wanted me to lean into orthodoxy, but I instead leaned against it and produced the talk that has prompted the most positive reaction of any I&rsquo;ve given.</p>
<p>This talk isn&rsquo;t exactly as I wrote it down or gave it, but I&rsquo;ve tried to preserve it as close to the original.</p>
<h1 id=the-importance-of-a-testimony-to-a-priesthood-holder>The importance of a testimony to a priesthood holder</h1>
<h2 id=intro>Intro</h2>
<p>Good evening brethren. It&rsquo;s good to be here with you.</p>
<p>Some of you, especially those of you who know me, may be wondering why I&rsquo;ve been asked to speak. I stand here today as a witness of what happens when you misplace your recommend before it expires and have to go back to Pres. Biggs before two years, right at the time when he&rsquo;s thinking about who to assign to speak.</p>
<p>Pres. Biggs and I had a wonderful discussion about testimonies, the topic he&rsquo;s asked me to speak about. I&rsquo;m grateful for priesthood leaders like my good bishop, and Pres. Biggs, who I know to be men of God, and with whom I felt confident to share how my faith has been challenged by uncertainty, and how my testimony hasn&rsquo;t only survived uncertainty, but thrived.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the great pleasure of meeting many people who have uncertainties about different aspects of the church. Some are with regard to historical facts. Others are about current practices and beliefs, and how they mesh with our societies changing understanding of issues like gender and sexual attraction. I&rsquo;m not going to address any specifics—the Church has released a series of essays that are a good start on the details—but most of you know someone who is facing these sorts of challenges. I&rsquo;d like to talk about how we can help them, or how you, if you&rsquo;re facing them yourself, can navigate the rough waters of uncertainty with honesty and find peace.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-testimony>What is a testimony?</h2>
<p>First, I&rsquo;d like to talk a little about what a testimony is. One thing I&rsquo;ve learned as I&rsquo;ve lived with my uncertainties is that a testimony isn&rsquo;t certainty, even though we often say &ldquo;I know&rdquo; when sharing one. <em>A testimony is a spiritual witness given by the Holy Ghost.</em> The Doctrine & Covenants describes two types of testimonies. We usually talk about the first, described in DC 46:13:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>13 To some it is given by the Holy Ghost to <strong>know</strong> that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that he was crucified for the sins of the world. (DC 46)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we often forget the other kind, found in verse 14:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>14 To others it is given to <strong>believe</strong> on their words, that they also might have eternal life if they continue faithful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider what this means, brothers. There we have it, in scripture, validation of two kinds of testimonies. There will be some among us who <em>know</em>, by the Holy Ghost, the truth of the Gospel. But there will be others, no less entitled to eternal life, who <em>believe</em> in the certain knowledge that others have. <em>Both</em> are valid testimonies. I know many of you in this room have been given the gift of the first kind of testimony, an unwaivering knowledge. I find myself in the latter category more often than not, and I&rsquo;m grateful for the gift as well. This scripture has blessed my life by helping me recognize the testimony that I do have, and helping me understand better how to help others recognize the testimonies and gift of belief that they have.</p>
<p>One key lesson I&rsquo;ve learned as I&rsquo;ve gotten older is that testimonies are more about <em>conviction</em> than <em>certainty</em>. That&rsquo;s something I learned from the account of Clayton Christensen&rsquo;s experience gaining his testimony. At the time, he was studying at Oxford university, far from home. He knew the demands of Mormonism would require a stronger testimony than he had, so he took it upon himself to study the Book of Mormon every night. At the conclusion, he heeded Moroni&rsquo;s admonition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. (Moroni 10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was his account of the experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After I had done this for several weeks, one evening in October 1975, as I sat in the chair and opened the book following my prayer, I felt a marvelous spirit come into the room and envelop my body. I had never before felt such an intense feeling of peace and love. I started to cry and did not want to stop. I knew then, from a source of understanding more powerful than anything I had ever felt in my life, that the book I was holding in my hands was true. It was hard to see through the tears. But as I opened it and began again to read, I saw in the word of the book a clarity and magnitude of God’s plan for us that I had never conceived before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes we think of Moroni&rsquo;s promise like an experiment of sorts: perform a test, and if results are positive, the thing is true, and if negative, they are false. But praying about the Book of Mormon is much more than a detached experiment. It&rsquo;s an experience. Because, as Clayton Christensen accounts, and as many of us experience, the answer is not an observation but a feeling, a taste of celestial glory, of perfect peace and luminous love. It at once confirms and motivates. For some, like myself, it doesn&rsquo;t give certainty about all the details, but it does give conviction—the motivation to continue in the path, in the hopes of feeling that way again. Like Nephi said, when posed with a difficult question to which he didn&rsquo;t have an answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>17 &mldr;I know that [God] loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things. (1 Ne 11)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That verse was probably the best thing I learned from my religion courses at BYU. I had a professor who had notoriously difficult tests, but if ever there was a question we didn&rsquo;t know the answer, we could always recite that scripture and get partial credit. At the time, I thought it was silly but was happy for the free points, but as I&rsquo;ve grown in experience and confronted difficult questions, I&rsquo;m so very grateful for the wisdom in that principle. Because I do not know the meaning of all things, and I&rsquo;m not really meant to. But I do know that God loveth his children, and that&rsquo;s been enough for full credit in the test of life.</p>
<h2 id=helping-others>Helping others</h2>
<p>So how do we help our good brothers and sisters who, when confronted by difficult questions, are shaken in their faith?</p>
<p>When Jesus was on the earth, he confronted many who doubted, but yearned to believe. In one occasion, he came across a man whose son was afflicted, and foaming at the mouth. Mark 9 records the account:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>23 Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>24 And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. (Mark 9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus&rsquo;s response was to give the man precisely what he needed in that moment, which was to be served, and have his son healed. In other instances, like when confronting the doubting Pharisees, Christ directed those who doubted to search the scriptures. In other instances, prayer is the answer. But there isn&rsquo;t one solution, and we do our friends a disservice if we only consider what works for us, without serving them where <em>they are</em> at. Often times, even having someone just to listen will help.</p>
<p>Think again about that gift of the spirit, the gift of believing in others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>14 To others it is given to <strong>believe</strong> on their words, that they also might have eternal life if they continue faithful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes we unintentionally cut off those who face uncertainties, or offer simplistic solutions, when what they need is a friend, someone who has a firm testimony who they trust and believe. I believe that&rsquo;s precisely why we have families, quorums, and wards. If there was one solution, the Lord could deliver it through a single mouthpiece. But there isn&rsquo;t one solution, and there&rsquo;s a rich variety of people that we have the privilege of serving and being served by. Those who face uncertainties deserve from us the kind of personal attention and love that the Father gives to each of us. As Christ said to Peter,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lovest thou me? Feed my sheep.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id=to-those-who-fall-away>To those who fall away</h3>
<p>Now, despite our best efforts, there will be some that lose their testimony and fall away. Some may even turn antagonist toward the church. Their pain is real, as they&rsquo;ve felt compelled to leave the church they once loved. Imagine the pain you would feel if your testimony, that feeling of joy, light, and peace you feel when the Holy Spirit manifests itself to you, was taken away. It leaves a huge hole, a real pain. Regardless of the reasons that people leave, they too deserve our love and understanding. Oftentimes the road back will be difficult, and many may never come back to full fellowship, but ours isn&rsquo;t to condemn but to patiently love as the Savior would.</p>
<h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Testimonies are a wonderful thing, and as all gifts of the spirit, come from diligently seeking them. Seek out those things that bring the spirit — prayers, scriptures, good music, uplifting friends, church service — and nourish that conviction you have. And even if you only have a desire to believe, as Alma the prophet promised, if you nourish that seed, it will grow into a tree of faith and support you. And when you come across those who are wavering in their faith, extend the hand of friendship, and be an example of the believers, and be a true friend. That&rsquo;s what the priesthood is all about.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

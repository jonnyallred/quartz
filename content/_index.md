Nothing is quite as conceited as putting your amateur writing on the internet. But I'm the kind of person who navigates life by thinking, and I think by writing. I open up my thoughts to you to get feedback. I am willing to change my mind on anything, but I have chosen to make certain intellectual commitments because I believe that [[notes/principles/strong opinions, weakly held]] are the surest path to knowledge.

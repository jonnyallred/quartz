title: "American Elites"
---
Every society has elites, because human beings vary widely in their talents, abilities, and attitudes. Elites are simply those that are on the top.

Elites are important to a society because they have an outsized impact on the productivity and quality of that society. A few excellent people are so effective at organizing people to coordinate their efforts toward a goal, coming up with new ideas, that they aren't just twice or even ten times as impactful as others, but a hundred, a thousand, or even a million times as impactful. Without these people, our lives would look a lot worse.

But because they are elite, they are also capable of harm. Or even just benign neglect. 

Unto whom much is given, much is required. 

Some like Freddie DeBoer say that we have too many elites. But I think the real problem is that our elites don't have a sense of responsibility. There are two variables: whether they feel responsible or entitled, and whether they feel like they are content or discontent. We have the dangerous combination of an elite class that feels both entitled and discontent. As a result, they want to improve their situation and don't feel any obligation to their society or to others, so they are willing to undermine the very institutions that have been built up over centuries to give us all we have, all in the hopes that it might improve their condition somewhat. 

Also, without understanding responsibility, they misunderstand those that came before them.

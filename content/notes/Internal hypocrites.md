We come into self-awareness when we first perceive someone perceiving us. 
> And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites _are_: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

But does that mean that anything we do in secret cannot be hypocritical? 
No. We live in a time where it is polite to obscure our status. Billionaires dress like everyone else. Status is something that's internally felt, but not externally manifested. This scripture isn't just about external manifestations of status, so even if we do good quietly and privately, but do so so that we can feel better than others in our own mind, we are still hypocrites and have our reward.

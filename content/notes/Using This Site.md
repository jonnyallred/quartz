### Site Directory
- [All Notes](/notes)

## Technical Details
My notes are written in [markdown]([Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)), a simple plaintext way to add basic formatting like _itallics_ and **bold** without trapping your writing in a proprietary, cumbersome format like Microsoft's docx, or in something uneditable like PDF. I use [Obsidian]([Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)) to write and organize my notes, and [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) to publish it to github.io.   

I want a solution that lets me take my content with me whereever I go and isn't too expensive to maintain ($20/mo is a lot to ask for something that's even simpler than a word processor). I think I'm getting close to finding an ideal solution.

### Features of Quartz
1. Extremely fast full-text search by pressing `Ctrl` + `k`
2. Customizable and hackable design based on Hugo
3. Automatically generated backlinks, link previews, and local graph
4. Built-in [[notes/CJK + Latex Support (测试) | CJK + Latex Support]]
5. Support for both Markdown Links and Wikilinks

### Other Things I Tried
- [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) - mind-opening program, especially how it automatically creates backlinks, creating a network of thought. But I hate how it forces you into a bulleted outline format. Most of my work is prose. Paragraphs are great.
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/personal)- an excellent editor with built-in database features. But I don't like how it departed from markdown. It makes editing paragraphs and essays cumbersome. Great for notes, though.
- [Onenote](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app) - I've never found a better program for taking hand-drawn notes in. I hope Microsoft copies elements from these other tools.

# Against Supremacy
Imagine there's a white interest group, to mirror the black and latino interest groups that many companies and organizations have. Such a group would predictably raise eyebrows, if not shouts and pitchforks. "White supremacy" would be the accusation. 
But imagine if such an interest group wanted only to pursue the interest of whites in the same way black interest groups pursue the interests of blacks? "They are the majority--the entire organization is their interest group" they might say, but even so, why shouldn't they be allowed to organize and discuss it as such, if that's what's being assumed? 
Imagine if such a group, being against white supremacy, had as it's first rule, 

1. No supremacists

Do black groups have such a rule? If not, why not? 
Being against "white supremacy" really includes two things: white, and supremacy. If you don't like white people, you can simply add "supremacy" to the end and have your way. Ironically, that, in itself, is a form of "supremacy," thinking that white people are inferior in some way, even if morally. 
Shouldn't we be against supremacy? White supremacists may have been the flavor of supremacy that was in power and committed injustice, but would it have been any less injustice had it been black supremacists who had been in power? Of course not. In fact, it would be a form of supremacistness to suppose that black supremacists would be any less injust than white ones. 
Every group should be against supremacy. Not just the white kind.

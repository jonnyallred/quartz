title: "Intimacy"
---

"Consent" isn't sufficient. It's not that intimacy should be non-consensual, but that the whole idea of two separate beings, each constantly approving or disapproving of the actions of the other, isn't what creates intimacy. It's just two people that occasionally please each other. 

True intimacy is achieved by mutual submission and domination. The will of the man subsumed into the will of the woman; the will of the woman subsumed into the will of the man. Each gives themselves up to the other, a supreme act of trust and expression of vulnerability. To possess another and be so possessed. To be one.

Elites are simply those that are on the top.\n\nElites are important to a society because they have an outsized impact on the productivity and quality of that society. A few excellent people are so effective at organizing people to coordinate their efforts toward a goal, coming up with new ideas, that they aren't just twice or even ten times as impactful as others, but a hundred, a thousand, or even a million times as impactful. Without these people, our lives would look a lot worse.\n\nBut because they are elite, they are also capable of harm. Or even just benign neglect. \n\nUnto whom much is given, much is required. \n\nSome like Freddie DeBoer say that we have too many elites. But I think the real problem is that our elites don't have a sense of responsibility. There are two variables: whether they feel responsible or entitled, and whether they feel like they are content or discontent. We have the dangerous combination of an elite class that feels both entitled and discontent. As a result, they want to improve their situation and don't feel any obligation to their society or to others, so they are willing to undermine the very institutions that have been built up over centuries to give us all we have, all in the hopes that it might improve their condition somewhat. \n\nAlso, without understanding responsibility, they misunderstand those that came before them.","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T06:02:31.369456233Z","tags":null},"/notes/Booting-Argument":{"title":"Booting Argument","content":"So, I browsed through a fiery debate that raged through provopulse a year or so back about the legitimacy of booting to enforce parking regulations, and wanted to bring it up again to see if we could generate some useful ideas on whether it is or is not ethical, and if it is not, what some alternatives might be.\nSo, here is why I think booting is unethical.\nNow, I realize enforcing regulations is usually a good thing.  I'm in full support of appropriate regulations, and I would sure like full benefit of a parking pass I pay for.  However, the model for businesses like University Parking Enforcement is what I question.  In my view, it abuses the leeway of City Ordinances in order to unethically take advantage of students in the Provo area.\n\nFirst, is the cost.  Typical city parking tickets cost about $10, whether a boot is included or not.  The city of Chicago charges $50 for parking in a blatant no parking zone, and only $25 for parking in a spot that doesn't belong to you.  And if you've ever been to downtown Chicago, you know that parking is much sparser than it is here.  The last time I checked, University Parking charged $60.  Is a parking spot here in Provo worth $60?  Isn't that a bit extreme of a cost, especially considering it's the maximum permissible by law to charge for a parking violation here in Provo?  Some may say that the high cost acts as a powerful deterrent, but when you consider the fact that many signs are occluded, and many regulatory times unclear, $60 seems like an awful lot to pay for inadvertent infractions, when deterrence isn't necessary.\n\nSecond, is the inflexibility.  Employees of the company are paid solely on commission, meaning if they want money, they have to boot.  If there's a student who took his friend to go grocery shopping and parks his car in the empty lot by his complex to help him unload everything, the observing view faces a choice: boot, even though the offending car is obviously not restricting parking in the lot, but rather helping a tenant, or go earn his wages.  It's an unfair position he's put in--no one should have to choose what he knows is morally correct in conflict with his job.  Some may appeal to the technicality of the law, that the car is technically in offense and should be punished, but all laws need to allow flexibility to account for the complexities of real life. This is a primary role of the police officer: to use judgment in the enforcement of the law.  Police squads rightfully do not place officer pay solely dependent on the tickets they write.  Imagine if they did.  Imagine if there were cameras at every stop sign, making sure you stopped completely, not an inch after the line.  Laws exist to serve the people, and police are the first line of defense against the laws taking control.  Booters, on the other hand, are not afforded this privilege, and are compelled to enforce.  \n\nThird, is the lack of a decent appeals process.  The complexes say they have no control (a lie), and University Parking puts up so much red tape that legitimate complaints have no chance.  This is definitely the responsibility of the complexes, and should be addressed.\n\nNow, alternatives.\n\nFirst, I ask if complexes that employee these companies are allowed to set price regulations?  And if so, why don't they?  $60 is just plain exorbitant, not even mentioning the $120+ some places charge for towing.  \n\nSecond, if the price must stay as an effective deterrent, what about a first time warning?  Of course, the booting company would never self-impose something like this, but could the complexes demand it?  I think so.  It wouldn't be hard to maintain a database of all cars warned and make this available to the booters.  The easiest way, I think, would be to go ahead and boot the car, and between the time the boots is placed and released, check the license plate against the record.  This would eliminate, I think, many innocent offenses.\n\nThird, what about the case of empty lots?  Do complexes really need to enforce when there are no cars in the lot?  There needs to be a stipulation in the system allowing for this.  Again, if booters weren't paid solely on commission, I think we would see less ridiculous enforcement.\n\nFinally, if University Parking wouldn't agree to any of this, would it be hard for the complex to regulate itself?  I mean, hiring someone to police the lots sounds like a good idea anyway considering the crime.  I wouldn't mind paying $10 extra a month for policed lots, which should more than cover the cost of hiring someone to do the job during the normal enforcement time (midnight to 9ish).  The above alternatives are all easier to implement when the complexes control the system, and would be much friendlier to the client.  Basically, rather than allow a company to harvest as much money as it can from their tenants, complex owners should have the tenants interests as their highest concern and employ much more beneficial measures.\n\nIf it sounds like a good idea, lets do something about it.","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T06:02:31.369456233Z","tags":null},"/notes/Internal-hypocrites":{"title":"Internal Hypocrites","content":"We come into self-awareness when we first perceive someone perceiving us. \n\u003e And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites _are_: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.

Hemmingway is a talented writer, especially for the male reader. He captures everything so well, from interpersonal relationships, to internal dialogue, to romance and sexual urges. \n\nThe story was also fascinating. I have seen many works of art reference the Spanish civil war, everything from Picasso's \"Guernica\" to *Pan's Labyrinth*. This, like the others, takes the side of the communists against the fascists. I somehow never managed to learn much about the Spanish civil war, probably for two reasons: first, it was, like the French revolution, a confusing mix of events and movements, and second, was immediately overshadowed by World War II. But what makes it especially interesting is that it comes before Communism really got its bad name. In the story, the Communists are the good guys. It was a time when Fascism was a dire threat. \n\nHemmingway helps me understand Communism better than I have before. One of the things that makes the book great is how detailed and honest he is. He apparently got some flak from progressives and communists for describing not just fascist atrocities, but the communist ones, too, and one particularly vivid and memorable chapter where the communists take a city, and make the fascists go through a gauntlet before being run or thrown off a cliff. He captures the mood of the mob as it goes from tentative, to agitated, to aggressive, to remorseful, to overcome by psychotic anarchists and drunks who then devolve into a violent mob. And of course it's that way. It's not like communists, fascists, British imperialists, American soldiers, or any other number of groups who have committed atrocities are a different species than you or I. The difference is the group dynamics, the emergent characteristics of the collective, particularly as different kinds of people become dominant (in this case, as the sociopaths took over). The book examines in detail how different people deal with the exigencies of war. A theme gets repeated that killing is necessary but wrong. \n\nThe book also highlighted what, I think, is the downfall of Communism, which is it's religious devotion to politics. There really isn't any difference between theocracy and this kind of communism (which has been the only kind of communism in power at meaningful scale). People are evaluated on their devotion to the Party, not necessarily on their technical skill. The protagonist in the book is an American professor working as a dynamiter in the war. But he, like Hemingway himself, while very sympathetic to the communist cause, was not a communist himself. It's easy for me to forget that even within communism, there is a division between party members and other comrades. It was the same in Nazism as well, with the SS being a separate entity from the military and other branches of government, and sometimes in conflict with it. Just as, during the heyday of Catholicism, the Church was not the same thing as the Government, even though the Church exerted total or near-total power over the government. Communism in many ways simply replaces the tokens of Fascism like the Church or the State with a different token, the Party. But the similarities dwarf the differences. Perhaps what made the US work so well was not solely recognizing that Church and state need be kept separate, but a more general principle that Ideology and State need be kept separate, the Church being only one kind of ideology, and perhaps not even the most dangerous kind. Because while the French Revolution also separated church and state, they failed to separate ideology and state, and the result was ugly. It makes me respect Washington so much more, that in his first Inauguration he would denounce political parties. Every other man in his position, it seems, used the opportunity to extol political partiesâ€”or at least his particular party. \n\n_(Warning: spoilers ahead)_\n\nThe book really brings this point home when discussing the different personnel in command of the Republican (communist) war effort. In one part of the story, [spoiler] a man is sent to deliver important information to the general who will be leading an offensive against the fascist lines. Hemmingway poignantly says that the man, who was one of the guerillas behind fascists lines, made his way speedily and without problem through fascist territory, but once he got to his own side, was besought be incompetence, stupidity, and paranoia. At one point, he reaches a political commmisar who is insane, who everyone knows is insane, but that no one does anything about because he was an important figure in the Communist party. [/spoiler] Political devotion literally makes the cause weaker, because it makes them stupider and less competent. One of the great business innovations of the 20th century was moving away from family management to professional managersâ€”the father and owner of a business hiring the guy who had talent and skill, as opposed to letting his incompetent son run the business into the ground. Such an obvious thing to us, but it's one of the reasons that the US became an economic powerhouse in the early 1900s, and then, after Europe was devastated by war, became the most dominant economic force the world has ever seen. Also one of the reasons why Mexico may still be lagging, because in Mexico the norm is still to take care of family first.\n\nThe insights of the book for today leapt off the page. We're observing the GOP accelerate along a transition from loose political affiliation to something that deserves allegiance, even over country. The Democrats were in many ways ahead of that transition before, now falling behind but still with a powerful, overriding Ideology that gets much too much deference, resulting in injustices and incompetence. And all of this can happen even if only a small percentage of the population is ideological. None of this bodes well. In a war between Fascists and Communists, nobody wins.","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T06:02:31.369456233Z","tags":null},"/notes/philosophy":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T06:02:31.369456233Z","tags":null},"/notes/principles/strong-opinions-weakly-held":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T06:02:31.369456233Z","tags":null},"/notes/religion/Value-of-a-Testimony":{"title":"Value of a Testimony","content":"# (Context)\nThis was a talk I gave in Stake Priesthood meeting in the summer of 2016. I'm certain I was given the assignment because I decided to be very frank with my [[glossary/stake|Stake]] Counselor about my lack of certainty. He assigned me to give a talk on the value of a testimony shortly afterward. I think he wanted me to lean into orthodoxy, but I instead leaned against it and produced the talk that has prompted the most positive reaction of any I've given. \n\nThis talk isn't exactly as I wrote it down or gave it, but I've tried to preserve it as close to the original. \n\n# The importance of a testimony to a priesthood holder\n\n## Intro\n\nGood evening brethren. It's good to be here with you. \n\nSome of you, especially those of you who know me, may be wondering why I've been asked to speak. I stand here today as a witness of what happens when you misplace your recommend before it expires and have to go back to Pres. Biggs before two years, right at the time when he's thinking about who to assign to speak. \n\nPres. Biggs and I had a wonderful discussion about testimonies, the topic he's asked me to speak about. I'm grateful for priesthood leaders like my good bishop, and Pres. Biggs, who I know to be men of God, and with whom I felt confident to share how my faith has been challenged by uncertainty, and how my testimony hasn't only survived uncertainty, but thrived. \n\nI've had the great pleasure of meeting many people who have uncertainties about different aspects of the church. Some are with regard to historical facts. Others are about current practices and beliefs, and how they mesh with our societies changing understanding of issues like gender and sexual attraction. I'm not going to address any specifics—the Church has released a series of essays that are a good start on the details—but most of you know someone who is facing these sorts of challenges. I'd like to talk about how we can help them, or how you, if you're facing them yourself, can navigate the rough waters of uncertainty with honesty and find peace.\n\n## What is a testimony?\n\nFirst, I'd like to talk a little about what a testimony is. One thing I've learned as I've lived with my uncertainties is that a testimony isn't certainty, even though we often say \"I know\" when sharing one. *A testimony is a spiritual witness given by the Holy Ghost.* The Doctrine \u0026 Covenants describes two types of testimonies. We usually talk about the first, described in DC 46:13:\n\n\u003e  13 To some it is given by the Holy Ghost to **know** that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that he was crucified for the sins of the world. (DC 46)\n\nBut we often forget the other kind, found in verse 14:\n\n \u003e 14 To others it is given to **believe** on their words, that they also might have eternal life if they continue faithful.\n\nConsider what this means, brothers. There we have it, in scripture, validation of two kinds of testimonies. There will be some among us who *know*, by the Holy Ghost, the truth of the Gospel. But there will be others, no less entitled to eternal life, who *believe* in the certain knowledge that others have. *Both* are valid testimonies. I know many of you in this room have been given the gift of the first kind of testimony, an unwaivering knowledge. I find myself in the latter category more often than not, and I'm grateful for the gift as well. This scripture has blessed my life by helping me recognize the testimony that I do have, and helping me understand better how to help others recognize the testimonies and gift of belief that they have. \n\nOne key lesson I've learned as I've gotten older is that testimonies are more about *conviction* than *certainty*. That's something I learned from the account of Clayton Christensen's experience gaining his testimony. At the time, he was studying at Oxford university, far from home. He knew the demands of Mormonism would require a stronger testimony than he had, so he took it upon himself to study the Book of Mormon every night. At the conclusion, he heeded Moroni's admonition:\n\n\u003e4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. (Moroni 10)\n\nThis was his account of the experience:\n\n\u003e After I had done this for several weeks, one evening in October 1975, as I sat in the chair and opened the book following my prayer, I felt a marvelous spirit come into the room and envelop my body. I had never before felt such an intense feeling of peace and love. I started to cry and did not want to stop. I knew then, from a source of understanding more powerful than anything I had ever felt in my life, that the book I was holding in my hands was true. It was hard to see through the tears. But as I opened it and began again to read, I saw in the word of the book a clarity and magnitude of God’s plan for us that I had never conceived before.\n\nSometimes we think of Moroni's promise like an experiment of sorts: perform a test, and if results are positive, the thing is true, and if negative, they are false. But praying about the Book of Mormon is much more than a detached experiment. It's an experience. Because, as Clayton Christensen accounts, and as many of us experience, the answer is not an observation but a feeling, a taste of celestial glory, of perfect peace and luminous love. It at once confirms and motivates. For some, like myself, it doesn't give certainty about all the details, but it does give conviction—the motivation to continue in the path, in the hopes of feeling that way again. Like Nephi said, when posed with a difficult question to which he didn't have an answer:\n\n\u003e 17 ...I know that [God] loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things. (1 Ne 11)\n\nThat verse was probably the best thing I learned from my religion courses at BYU. I had a professor who had notoriously difficult tests, but if ever there was a question we didn't know the answer, we could always recite that scripture and get partial credit. At the time, I thought it was silly but was happy for the free points, but as I've grown in experience and confronted difficult questions, I'm so very grateful for the wisdom in that principle. Because I do not know the meaning of all things, and I'm not really meant to. But I do know that God loveth his children, and that's been enough for full credit in the test of life. \n\n## Helping others\n\nSo how do we help our good brothers and sisters who, when confronted by difficult questions, are shaken in their faith? \n\nWhen Jesus was on the earth, he confronted many who doubted, but yearned to believe. In one occasion, he came across a man whose son was afflicted, and foaming at the mouth. Mark 9 records the account: \n\n\u003e 23 Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.\n\n\u003e 24 And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. (Mark 9)\n\nJesus's response was to give the man precisely what he needed in that moment, which was to be served, and have his son healed. In other instances, like when confronting the doubting Pharisees, Christ directed those who doubted to search the scriptures. In other instances, prayer is the answer.  But there isn't one solution, and we do our friends a disservice if we only consider what works for us, without serving them where *they are* at. Often times, even having someone just to listen will help.\n\nThink again about that gift of the spirit, the gift of believing in others.\n\n\u003e 14 To others it is given to **believe** on their words, that they also might have eternal life if they continue faithful.\n\nSometimes we unintentionally cut off those who face uncertainties, or offer simplistic solutions, when what they need is a friend, someone who has a firm testimony who they trust and believe. I believe that's precisely why we have families, quorums, and wards. If there was one solution, the Lord could deliver it through a single mouthpiece. But there isn't one solution, and there's a rich variety of people that we have the privilege of serving and being served by. Those who face uncertainties deserve from us the kind of personal attention and love that the Father gives to each of us. As Christ said to Peter, \n\n\u003e Lovest thou me? Feed my sheep.\n\n### To those who fall away\n\nNow, despite our best efforts, there will be some that lose their testimony and fall away. Some may even turn antagonist toward the church. Their pain is real, as they've felt compelled to leave the church they once loved. Imagine the pain you would feel if your testimony, that feeling of joy, light, and peace you feel when the Holy Spirit manifests itself to you, was taken away. It leaves a huge hole, a real pain. Regardless of the reasons that people leave, they too deserve our love and understanding. Oftentimes the road back will be difficult, and many may never come back to full fellowship, but ours isn't to condemn but to patiently love as the Savior would.\n\n## Conclusion\nTestimonies are a wonderful thing, and as all gifts of the spirit, come from diligently seeking them. Seek out those things that bring the spirit — prayers, scriptures, good music, uplifting friends, church service — and nourish that conviction you have. And even if you only have a desire to believe, as Alma the prophet promised, if you nourish that seed, it will grow into a tree of faith and support you. And when you come across those who are wavering in their faith, extend the hand of friendship, and be an example of the believers, and be a true friend. That's what the priesthood is all about.\n\nIn the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T06:02:31.369456233Z","tags":null}}

Such a group would predictably raise eyebrows, if not shouts and pitchforks. \"White supremacy\" would be the accusation. \nBut imagine if such an interest group wanted only to pursue the interest of whites in the same way black interest groups pursue the interests of blacks? \"They are the majority--the entire organization is their interest group\" they might say, but even so, why shouldn't they be allowed to organize and discuss it as such, if that's what's being assumed? \nImagine if such a group, being against white supremacy, had as it's first rule, \n1. No supremacists\nDo black groups have such a rule? If not, why not? \nBeing against \"white supremacy\" really includes two things: white, and supremacy. If you don't like white people, you can simply add \"supremacy\" to the end and have your way. Ironically, that, in itself, is a form of \"supremacy,\" thinking that white people are inferior in some way, even if morally. \nShouldn't we be against supremacy? White supremacists may have been the flavor of supremacy that was in power and committed injustice, but would it have been any less injustice had it been black supremacists who had been in power? Of course not. In fact, it would be a form of supremacistness to suppose that black supremacists would be any less injust than white ones. \nEvery group should be against supremacy.

Elites are simply those that are on the top.\n\nElites are important to a society because they have an outsized impact on the productivity and quality of that society. A few excellent people are so effective at organizing people to coordinate their efforts toward a goal, coming up with new ideas, that they aren't just twice or even ten times as impactful as others, but a hundred, a thousand, or even a million times as impactful. Without these people, our lives would look a lot worse.\n\nBut because they are elite, they are also capable of harm. Or even just benign neglect. \n\nUnto whom much is given, much is required. \n\nSome like Freddie DeBoer say that we have too many elites. But I think the real problem is that our elites don't have a sense of responsibility. There are two variables: whether they feel responsible or entitled, and whether they feel like they are content or discontent. We have the dangerous combination of an elite class that feels both entitled and discontent. As a result, they want to improve their situation and don't feel any obligation to their society or to others, so they are willing to undermine the very institutions that have been built up over centuries to give us all we have, all in the hopes that it might improve their condition somewhat. \n\nAlso, without understanding responsibility, they misunderstand those that came before them.","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T00:06:40.986141859Z","tags":null},"/notes/Booting-Argument":{"title":"Booting Argument","content":"So, I browsed through a fiery debate that raged through provopulse a year or so back about the legitimacy of booting to enforce parking regulations, and wanted to bring it up again to see if we could generate some useful ideas on whether it is or is not ethical, and if it is not, what some alternatives might be.\nSo, here is why I think booting is unethical.\nNow, I realize enforcing regulations is usually a good thing.  I'm in full support of appropriate regulations, and I would sure like full benefit of a parking pass I pay for.  However, the model for businesses like University Parking Enforcement is what I question.  In my view, it abuses the leeway of City Ordinances in order to unethically take advantage of students in the Provo area.\n\nFirst, is the cost.  Typical city parking tickets cost about $10, whether a boot is included or not.  The city of Chicago charges $50 for parking in a blatant no parking zone, and only $25 for parking in a spot that doesn't belong to you.  And if you've ever been to downtown Chicago, you know that parking is much sparser than it is here.  The last time I checked, University Parking charged $60.  Is a parking spot here in Provo worth $60?  Isn't that a bit extreme of a cost, especially considering it's the maximum permissible by law to charge for a parking violation here in Provo?  Some may say that the high cost acts as a powerful deterrent, but when you consider the fact that many signs are occluded, and many regulatory times unclear, $60 seems like an awful lot to pay for inadvertent infractions, when deterrence isn't necessary.\n\nSecond, is the inflexibility.  Employees of the company are paid solely on commission, meaning if they want money, they have to boot.  If there's a student who took his friend to go grocery shopping and parks his car in the empty lot by his complex to help him unload everything, the observing view faces a choice: boot, even though the offending car is obviously not restricting parking in the lot, but rather helping a tenant, or go earn his wages.  It's an unfair position he's put in--no one should have to choose what he knows is morally correct in conflict with his job.  Some may appeal to the technicality of the law, that the car is technically in offense and should be punished, but all laws need to allow flexibility to account for the complexities of real life. This is a primary role of the police officer: to use judgment in the enforcement of the law.  Police squads rightfully do not place officer pay solely dependent on the tickets they write.  Imagine if they did.  Imagine if there were cameras at every stop sign, making sure you stopped completely, not an inch after the line.  Laws exist to serve the people, and police are the first line of defense against the laws taking control.  Booters, on the other hand, are not afforded this privilege, and are compelled to enforce.  \n\nThird, is the lack of a decent appeals process.  The complexes say they have no control (a lie), and University Parking puts up so much red tape that legitimate complaints have no chance.  This is definitely the responsibility of the complexes, and should be addressed.\n\nNow, alternatives.\n\nFirst, I ask if complexes that employee these companies are allowed to set price regulations?  And if so, why don't they?  $60 is just plain exorbitant, not even mentioning the $120+ some places charge for towing.  \n\nSecond, if the price must stay as an effective deterrent, what about a first time warning?  Of course, the booting company would never self-impose something like this, but could the complexes demand it?  I think so.  It wouldn't be hard to maintain a database of all cars warned and make this available to the booters.  The easiest way, I think, would be to go ahead and boot the car, and between the time the boots is placed and released, check the license plate against the record.  This would eliminate, I think, many innocent offenses.\n\nThird, what about the case of empty lots?  Do complexes really need to enforce when there are no cars in the lot?  There needs to be a stipulation in the system allowing for this.  Again, if booters weren't paid solely on commission, I think we would see less ridiculous enforcement.\n\nFinally, if University Parking wouldn't agree to any of this, would it be hard for the complex to regulate itself?  I mean, hiring someone to police the lots sounds like a good idea anyway considering the crime.  I wouldn't mind paying $10 extra a month for policed lots, which should more than cover the cost of hiring someone to do the job during the normal enforcement time (midnight to 9ish).  The above alternatives are all easier to implement when the complexes control the system, and would be much friendlier to the client.  Basically, rather than allow a company to harvest as much money as it can from their tenants, complex owners should have the tenants interests as their highest concern and employ much more beneficial measures.\n\nIf it sounds like a good idea, lets do something about it.","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T00:06:40.986141859Z","tags":null},"/notes/Internal-hypocrites":{"title":"Internal Hypocrites","content":"We come into self-awareness when we first perceive someone perceiving us. \n\u003e And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites _are_: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.

Billionaires dress like everyone else. Status is something that's internally felt, but not externally manifested.

Hemmingway is a talented writer, especially for the male reader. He captures everything so well, from interpersonal relationships, to internal dialogue, to romance and sexual urges. \n\nThe story was also fascinating. I have seen many works of art reference the Spanish civil war, everything from Picasso's \"Guernica\" to *Pan's Labyrinth*. This, like the others, takes the side of the communists against the fascists. I somehow never managed to learn much about the Spanish civil war, probably for two reasons: first, it was, like the French revolution, a confusing mix of events and movements, and second, was immediately overshadowed by World War II. But what makes it especially interesting is that it comes before Communism really got its bad name. In the story, the Communists are the good guys. It was a time when Fascism was a dire threat. \n\nHemmingway helps me understand Communism better than I have before. One of the things that makes the book great is how detailed and honest he is. He apparently got some flak from progressives and communists for describing not just fascist atrocities, but the communist ones, too, and one particularly vivid and memorable chapter where the communists take a city, and make the fascists go through a gauntlet before being run or thrown off a cliff. He captures the mood of the mob as it goes from tentative, to agitated, to aggressive, to remorseful, to overcome by psychotic anarchists and drunks who then devolve into a violent mob. And of course it's that way. It's not like communists, fascists, British imperialists, American soldiers, or any other number of groups who have committed atrocities are a different species than you or I. The difference is the group dynamics, the emergent characteristics of the collective, particularly as different kinds of people become dominant (in this case, as the sociopaths took over). The book examines in detail how different people deal with the exigencies of war. A theme gets repeated that killing is necessary but wrong. \n\nThe book also highlighted what, I think, is the downfall of Communism, which is it's religious devotion to politics. There really isn't any difference between theocracy and this kind of communism (which has been the only kind of communism in power at meaningful scale). People are evaluated on their devotion to the Party, not necessarily on their technical skill. The protagonist in the book is an American professor working as a dynamiter in the war. But he, like Hemingway himself, while very sympathetic to the communist cause, was not a communist himself. It's easy for me to forget that even within communism, there is a division between party members and other comrades. It was the same in Nazism as well, with the SS being a separate entity from the military and other branches of government, and sometimes in conflict with it. Just as, during the heyday of Catholicism, the Church was not the same thing as the Government, even though the Church exerted total or near-total power over the government. Communism in many ways simply replaces the tokens of Fascism like the Church or the State with a different token, the Party. But the similarities dwarf the differences. Perhaps what made the US work so well was not solely recognizing that Church and state need be kept separate, but a more general principle that Ideology and State need be kept separate, the Church being only one kind of ideology, and perhaps not even the most dangerous kind. Because while the French Revolution also separated church and state, they failed to separate ideology and state, and the result was ugly. It makes me respect Washington so much more, that in his first Inauguration he would denounce political parties. Every other man in his position, it seems, used the opportunity to extol political partiesâ€”or at least his particular party. \n\n_(Warning: spoilers ahead)_\n\nThe book really brings this point home when discussing the different personnel in command of the Republican (communist) war effort. In one part of the story, [spoiler] a man is sent to deliver important information to the general who will be leading an offensive against the fascist lines. Hemmingway poignantly says that the man, who was one of the guerillas behind fascists lines, made his way speedily and without problem through fascist territory, but once he got to his own side, was besought be incompetence, stupidity, and paranoia. At one point, he reaches a political commmisar who is insane, who everyone knows is insane, but that no one does anything about because he was an important figure in the Communist party. [/spoiler] Political devotion literally makes the cause weaker, because it makes them stupider and less competent. One of the great business innovations of the 20th century was moving away from family management to professional managersâ€”the father and owner of a business hiring the guy who had talent and skill, as opposed to letting his incompetent son run the business into the ground. Such an obvious thing to us, but it's one of the reasons that the US became an economic powerhouse in the early 1900s, and then, after Europe was devastated by war, became the most dominant economic force the world has ever seen. Also one of the reasons why Mexico may still be lagging, because in Mexico the norm is still to take care of family first.\n\nThe insights of the book for today leapt off the page. We're observing the GOP accelerate along a transition from loose political affiliation to something that deserves allegiance, even over country. The Democrats were in many ways ahead of that transition before, now falling behind but still with a powerful, overriding Ideology that gets much too much deference, resulting in injustices and incompetence. And all of this can happen even if only a small percentage of the population is ideological. None of this bodes well. In a war between Fascists and Communists, nobody wins.","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T00:06:40.986141859Z","tags":null},"/notes/philosophy":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T00:06:40.986141859Z","tags":null},"/notes/principles/strong-opinions-weakly-held":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T00:06:40.986141859Z","tags":null}}
